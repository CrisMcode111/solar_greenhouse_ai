# Solar Greenhouse AI – Experimental Project

This repository contains an experimental AI project exploring the use of data and predictive models in the context of a **solar greenhouse**.

The project was developed during an AI bootcamp as an applied exploration combining:
- data analysis
- basic machine learning techniques
- sustainability-oriented use cases

This repository is intentionally lightweight and experimental in nature.
