# Solar Greenhouse AI

## Overview

Solar Greenhouse AI is an experimental applied AI project exploring how **data-driven models and frugal AI techniques** can be used in the context of a **solar greenhouse**.

The project investigates how lightweight machine learning approaches can support decision-making related to plant growth, environmental conditions, and sustainability, while remaining compatible with **low-resource and energy-efficient constraints**.

This repository represents an early-stage research and exploration project.

---

## Motivation

Small-scale greenhouses and home growers often operate with:
- limited sensors,
- limited computing resources,
- and minimal automation.

Rather than relying on heavy models or cloud-dependent systems, this project explores:
- **frugal AI approaches**,  
- **model pruning and simplification**,  
- and **resource-aware experimentation**,  

as a way to bring AI closer to real-world, low-cost agricultural setups.

---

## Current State

At its current stage, the project consists of:
- exploratory data analysis,
- early machine learning experiments,
- and initial reflections on model performance and resource usage.

The work was initiated during an AI bootcamp as part of an applied learning process and is intentionally kept **lightweight and experimental**.

---

## Technical Direction (Exploratory)

Potential technical directions explored or considered in this project include:
- basic predictive models for environmental or plant-related variables,
- comparison between full and simplified (pruned) models,
- evaluation of model size, inference time, and feasibility on low-resource setups,
- experimentation aligned with **frugal AI principles**.

No production system is implemented at this stage.

## Vision & Future Work

Possible future extensions of this project may include:
- deeper exploration of frugal AI and pruning techniques,
- integration with simple sensor data (temperature, humidity, light),
- edge or low-power deployment experiments,
- sustainability-oriented optimization and decision support.

This project is intentionally open-ended and may evolve into a research prototype, a learning reference, or a more applied system over time.

---

## Project Status

This repository is currently in an **experimental and exploratory phase**.

Development is paused intentionally and will resume when time and research focus allow.

---

## Notes

This project reflects a personal interest in:
- applied AI systems,
- sustainability and food-related contexts,
- and thoughtful experimentation beyond purely theoretical models.

It is not intended as a production-ready solution.
